    <h1>CSS Intro and Practice</h1>
    <p>This is my way of following along with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css#semantic-html" 
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
        The Odin Project's CSS Intro</a>. This is a reference to my knowledge level at the 
        very beginning of this lesson.
    </p>
    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <img src="img/css-syntax.jpg">
    <h4>Universal Selector</h4>
    * {
        color: purple;
    }

    <h4>Type Selectors (AKA Element Selectors)</h4>
    &lt;!-- index.html --&gt;

    <div>Hello, World!</div>
    <div>Hello again!</div>
    <p>Hi...</p>
    <div>Okay, bye.</div>

    <p>/* styles.css */
    div {
        color: white;
    }</p>
    <p>Type (Element) Selectors apply to all html elements of a known type. 
        In this case all the 'div' type elements will be effected, and not the 'p' type elements.
    </p>

    <h4>Class Selectors</h4>
    &lt;!-- index.html --&gt;

    <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>

    <p>/* styles.css */
    .alert-text{
        color: red;
    }</p>
    <p>The Class Selector will select all elements with a given class. A class is an 
        attribute you place on an html element (alert-text). The syntax for class Selectors
        and all selectors cannot be named with a leading number. For example 4lert-text 
        would fail in the scenario above.
    </p>
    <p>another thing with class attributes is that you can add multiple classes to a single
        element. class="alert-text severe-alert" is totally legal syntax. This also shows
        that whitespace is used in ways to separate classes and you should always give names
        a hyphen instead of spaces.
    </p>

    <h4>ID Selectors</h4>
    &lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
    <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>

    /* styles.css */
    #title{
        background-color: red;
    }

    <p>Instead of a period, ID's use a hashtag. It is a common pitfall to use the ID attribute
        when classes will suffice. ID's should be used sparingly and for specific use cases
        such as links redirecting to a section on the current page, or taking advantage of
        specificity. Leading Digits are also illegal with ID syntax.
    </p>

    <h4>Grouping Selectors</h4>
    .read {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    /* several unique declarations */
    }

    .unread {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    /* several unique declarations */
    }
    <p>both .read and .unread share color and background-color selectors. These can be 
        comma separated as follows:
    </p>
    .read,
    .unread {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
    }

    .read {
    /* several unique declarations */
    }

    .unread {
    /* several unique declarations */
    }

    <p>Both examples will work and have the same result, but the second example reduces
        repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit both classes at once.
    </p>

    <h4>Chaining Selectors</h4>
    &lt;div class="subsection header"&gt;Latest Posts&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="subsection preview"&gt;This is where a preview for a post may go.&lt;/p&gt;

    .subsection.header{
        color: red;
    }
    <p>What .subsection.header does is it selects any element that has both subsection AND 
        header classes. This syntax can be used to chain any combo of selectors, except Chaining
        more than one Type Selector.
    </p>

    <p>You can chain classes and an ID, for example the preview selector where an ID selector:</p>
    &lt;p class="subsection" id="preview"&gt;This is where a preview may go&lt;/p&gt;
    
    .subsection#preview{
        color: blue;
    }

    <h4>Descendant Combinator</h4>
    <p>Cominators allow us to combine selectors differently than grouping or chaining, and 
        they show a relationship between selectors. There are 4 types of combinators, but 
        for now we'll go into the Descendant Combinator.
    </p>
    <p>Descendant Combinator is represented as a single space between selectors. classes
      are nested within eachother with the topmost class being the 'ancestor' and classes
      neseted within the ancestor are called 'children'. For example:
    </p>
    <p>&lt;div class="ancestor"&gt;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div class="child"&gt;</p>
    <p>While the css would look like the following:</p>
    .ancestor .child{
        Some Declarations
    }
