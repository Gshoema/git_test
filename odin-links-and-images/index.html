    <!-- rel describes the relationship between the current page and the linked document
       noopener value ensures that newly opened window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk. 
       noreferrer value provides privacy and security. it provides the behavior of noopener while also preventing the new page from knowing where the user came from-->
       
    <!-- using rel="noreferrer" you get both benefits -->
